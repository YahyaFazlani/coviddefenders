      <h1>Basic Precautions</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>Wear a mask - Wear a properly fitted mask when physical distancing is not possible and in poorly ventilated
          settings.
        </li>
        <li>Clean your hands - Clean your hands frequently with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.</li>
        <li>Maintain social distancing - Keep physical distance of at least 1 metre from others, even if they don’t
          appear to be
          sick. Avoid crowds and close contact.</li>
        <li>Get vaccinated - Get vaccinated as soon as it’s your turn and follow local guidance on vaccination.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Steps to wear a mask</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Clean your hands with soap and water or hand sanitizer before touching the mask.
        </li>
        <li>Remove a mask from the box and make sure there are no obvious tears or holes in either side of the mask.
        </li>
        <li>Determine which side of the mask is the top. The side of the mask that has a stiff bendable edge is the top
          and is meant
          to mold to the shape of your nose.</li>
        <li>Determine which side of the mask is the front. The colored side of the mask is usually the front and should
          face away
          from you, while the white side touches your face.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h1>Precautions to take outside your home</h1>
      <p>Avoid touching things and resort to gloves. Avoid touching hands, nose and mouth. Use a mask whenever you step
        out of
        the house and if not, cover your mouth with tissue or closed elbow while coughing or sneezing. Try to stay away
        from the
        people who appear to be sick.</p>
      <h1>Precautions to take when someone you know has COVID-19</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Help the person who is sick follow their doctor’s instructions for care and medicine.</li>
        <li>For most people, symptoms last a few days, and people usually feel better after a week.</li>
        <li>See if over-the-counter medicines for fever help the person feel better.
        </li>
        <li>Make sure the person who is sick drinks a lot of fluids and rests.
        </li>
        <li>Help them with grocery shopping, filling prescriptions, and getting other items they may need. Consider
          having the items
          delivered through a delivery service, if possible.
        </li>
        <li>Take care of their pet(s), and limit contact between the person who is sick and their pet(s) when possible.
        </li>
      </ul>
